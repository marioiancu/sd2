# Data structures
## Binomial heaps excel in scenarios with:

- Sparse Heaps: Operations on heaps with few elements are efficient.
- Frequent Minimum Deletions: Binomial heaps can delete the minimum element quickly.
- Balanced Insertions/Deletions: A mix of insertions and deletions is handled efficiently.
- Frequent Heap Merges: Merging two heaps is a fast operation in binomial heaps.
